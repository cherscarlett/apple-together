### Collecting Goodbye Messages From Former Apple Employees

Hi there,

Thank you for visiting!  If you came here because you recently left Apple due to the executive team’s inflexible remote work policy, or because you know someone who did, we are interested in hearing from you!

We are AppleTogether, a solidarity union of workers from all parts of Apple. You can learn more about us [here](/).

We want to give our former colleagues who have left Apple due to the executive team’s forced return to office (RTO) policies a way to say goodbye, and to explain why they left. We would also like to express our deepest regrets that they felt compelled to leave to begin with.

We are publishing their stories to push Apple to do better. 

If you have left Apple due to RTO or Apple’s inflexible policies, please fill out the survey below.

The survey asks you to fill out the following details:
* Your name (required, but kept private)
* Some way to verify that you are you and you worked for Apple
* At least one of the following to be published:
  * A testimony
  * A name
  * A profile picture

Should you choose to help, we only require certain pieces of information, but providing all pieces we are seeking is not required. You can choose any combination of your name, testimony, and photo, however,we believe providing all three would send the strongest message. 

Before you submit the survey, we will show you a preview of which information would be published. If you provide an email address, we’ll also send you all your entered information via email for reference.

If you do not feel comfortable providing this information via a survey on the internet, you can also email us directly at goodbyeapple@appletogether.org. Also use this email address if you have further questions.

We plan to publish all stories, names and pictures we receive here on this page by May 31st. To make sure your story can be included, please send it to us by May 29th. Otherwise, we’ll just add it later. 

Thank you for your consideration!
