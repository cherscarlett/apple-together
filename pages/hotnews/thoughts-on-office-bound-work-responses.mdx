### Comments from People Signing the Letter

Many people shared their reasons with us why location-flexible work is important to them and others. If you haven't read the original letter, yet, you can do so <Link href="thoughts-on-office-bound-work">here</Link>.

      <LetterComment 
          comment="My team members are located in different offices. Sister teams are also distributed. We use webex for all meetings anyways. Why enforce RTO for everyone even if it reduces productivity?"

      />

      <LetterComment 
          comment="I do value face-to-face communication and collaboration. But most of the time my work can be done remotely and I have a young child. I am currently going in the office once a week and want to keep it this way. I maintain higher productivity when I am not stressed about commuting (1.5-2 hrs one way). Also, whoever can work remotely should continue to do so for our environment."

          comment="I love being in the office to collaborate and meet teammates face to face, but M TU TH is too much. Tuesday and Thursday is the max we should do. Tuesday alone is perfect."

      />

      <LetterComment 
          comment="Lately apple products have gone downhill due in fact of this excessive need of parenting. Also the high cost of living near apple makes me worry more about how I’m going to make payments versus being creative. When I worked remotely I didn’t have this worry. Also Apple is supposed to be conscious about the environment how is making your employees come into work making this possible."

      <LetterComment 
          comment="I moved to another country only to work for Apple and so, it would be amazing to be able to work remotely closer to my family sometimes without the “exception” pressure." 
          company="Apple, Corporate"
      />

      <LetterComment 
          comment="The value of flexibility and self-determination are crucial. Treating employees like adults would go a long way - employees who feel heard and trusted are proven to be much more productive. This would also go a very long way in reducing the ongoing talent bleed Apple is currently experiencing, which could very well result in near to long term profit loss from turnover."

      <blockquote className={lettercommentstyles.lettercomment}>
            Work location-flexibility provides people the option to be and do their best work while also fulfilling Apple’s credo of,<br/>
            “We give more than we take.<br/>
            From the planet,”<br/>
            as work from home reduces unnecessary energy consumption and opens up more time (gift of time) for workers to be with home family.

        comment="Flexibility, time & productivity, commute. This letter speaks the exact same sentiments I carry in my everyday, now. My workflow has expanded during the pandemic, and has immediate requirements for conducting workflow not suitable for a desk (let alone our future bench seats at the new Austin campus). I'm 50 years old. I know my impact, and I do what's needed to do my job effectively - any slack on my part would immediately be noticed by my leadership. Let's not miss mention of my having lost FOUR colleagues who supported my workflow who have left the company or are re-tasked to 'shinier' projects... leaving me to pick up the bandwidth pieces. I'm drowning in workflow, and I've been directly told by my manager that there's no support on the horizon. Get out of my way, empower me, enable me to do my life's best work. Lest, I have to find a more supportive environment to do so."

        comment="I work as at home advisor (AHA) since 2018. A dream came true since I do not live or intend to live close to an office.  It was already hard for career growth from the beginning, but not impossible. But now, a relocation package is offered, and now for sure, I feel my job is in jeopardy. I always felt safe, having a job security, but now... unsure what will happen."

        comment="For many years, I was one of the remote team members at my (non apple) employer (hardware design). I am at one company site, but the vast majority of my colleagues at at other sites. So, remote work has been beneficial to me as there were *fewer* of those informal hallway meetings to which I was not invited.  Combining #1 and #2 of your letter, for remote people, those informal meetings are detrimental to our productivity...."

        comment="At our company, the same “leadership” team that requests assistant to come to NYC office 4 times a week are the ones that never ever show up. Basically, the boomers saying we need to come to the office for the “camaraderie” but they are working from the comfort of their home in Florida. Can't wait for Gen Z to take over and for the boomers to finally retire."

      <LetterComment 
        comment="If Apple truly believed a one size fits all solution was best, then we'd sell exactly one size and colour of product, we'd have unisex changing rooms and toilets, we'd have one pay rate, and one size of t-shirt. But we don't; we appreciate that our people and our customers are different with different needs. So why is that actual sane thinking not applied to our flexibility?"

        comment="Amazing text summarising all the most important points of knowledge workers after the pandemic (or before the next one!). Deciding when to work from the office increases work-life balance and in turn my output and commitment. I considered working for Apple in the past but with this policy in place I am not sure I will even try. Better wait and see! Good luck to the rest Apple employees! They are doing a great job!"

        comment="It takes 2 hrs for me to reach office, since 4 years it has been the most boring 2 hrs of my life. But pandemic crushed this mindset. Now, I spent those 2 hrs — seeing my toddler trying to argue/speak with me, my also working wife enjoying cooking us homemade food. I used to think these were trivial, but not anymore. These are the only two people in my life, for whom I wake up everyday to do my job at Apple. Now the idea of returning to office makes me choose my family over anything else, I want to work for a company that understands this."

On a single income, even as generous as Apple’s are, I cannot afford to move closer as rents have skyrocketed. Being able to work 100% remotely enabled me to be both a better employee and mother. Now I’m more exhausted, and both are suffering. Thank you for doing this, for all of us, the silent majority."

        comment="For one, the environment.  Having so many cars on the road, even three days a week, is so detrimental to the planet.  Two, for mental health.  Commuting is a horrible way to spend time, twice a day.  It's really been difficult on my mental health.  Three, I can do 95% of my job at home, I have even excelled doing so, mandatorily telling people 3x days/week is not really fair.  I could go one, but thats the big three."

Now that they are requiring everyone to be onsite they have also enforced a no promotion policy for people that work from home 100%. You are required to relocate to an onsite location if you want any career growth. It’s so sad that they are forcing dedicated employees like myself to now look for employment elsewhere so I’m not stuck with goalless work or opportunities to grow with the company."

        comment="Couldn’t agree more with all six points in this letter. I used to work for Apple when they were first piloting the “At Home Advisors” for AppleCare. I was recruited at my college campus and loved how flexible it was with my college schedule. Fast forward to after graduation, I get a different job that is full-time in the office. Then the pandemic and switch to 100% remote overnight. I quickly found myself reflecting back on my time at Apple and how grateful I was for such a flexible job and work schedule. I don’t think I ever want to return 100% back in an office. I love being able to pick what works best for me and let my performance dictate to management if working  remotely is worthwhile."

        comment="My Fortune 500 company forced us back to the office last year. I, like so many others, moved to another city during COVID. There was a company satellite office there which I was now mandated to return to. When I went in, I spoke to NO ONE. I put on heels, walked down long corridors to go to the bathroom, hid in conference rooms for Zoom calls since no colleagues lived in my city, and did the exact same thing I did at home... only worse. Worse yet, my dog had to be boarded ($30) and I had to pay for parking downtown ($20). It cost me $50 per day, not including gas, to do worse work. This is why I left and now work for a different Fortune 500 company that cares about their employees' lives. Until Apple changes course, they're only feigning care for their workers. Get with the future of work or lose your incredible talent for cutting-edge tech companies who already did."

In the renovated store, I started having panic attacks nearly every shift. I did not realize it at the time, but I had sensory issues, which were exacerbated by the tall ceilings, stainless steel walls, and unwelcoming environmental factors. I did not have an alternative to working in person in the store: I would either need to apply to a different store (too far), an online position (rigorous interviews), or leave the company. If I had had the option to move to remote retail, I would have been able to stay at Apple (which I wanted!) and continue contributing to the team.

Moreover, I don't want to go to the office to be on video calls all day long and realize that I could have done this at home.

Apple has made it possible for so many companies to work remotely and yet they are chaining employees to their desks?

        Honestly, I don't think it's fair that the working people keeping the world afloat have to make this issue about enhancing a company's profit margins and work flow. 

        Do you know how much more work you do than your elders did at your age?? How much more you get done in a fraction of the time??? Seriously, do not just discount this like it's the way the world works. You are working circles around everyone making the decision to force you back into the office compared to what they did before all this technology existed that created this increase in productivity. And look what they are doing to it: withholding it from us, the creators and maintainers of it all, because they "feel" like you should be in the office. 

        I can't count how many times have I heard an executive say "I can't wait to see your smiling faces back in these seats" when the only time we see their face is when they're walking into the office from their special parking spot to get to their exclusive floor and secluded office. 

        We do not owe any boss an explanation for our demands at work. If there is a possibility of remote work (barring financial/tech limitations), the choice needs to be placed in the hands of the workers. We run the show. We keep the ship afloat. It's time to stop playing around and finally take back our dignity as workers.

        At my company after nearly two decades of double digit percentage growth we had our first year of missing targets the year before lockdowns started. During lockdown despite restricted trading for several months we went on to set several company records while everyone was working from home. Our leadership praised us as a company. I was personally told my performance had never been better. I worked harder than I ever had, but I felt more rested than I ever had too. I had a good job, it literally became a perfect job. 

        I enjoy my colleagues, I believe there is value in face to face. But I don't need this everyday. No one does. After tasting perfection, working on a hybrid model is crushing. I waste so much time just getting ready for work, instead of getting straight to it. I arrive tired after a boring commute, instead of having a super productive first hour of work. I talk to colleagues to rebuild up the energy I didn't need to lose. But the time I start 2 productive hours are gone. When my day ended, my rest used to start immediately, now I need to pack up, travel, pack down, change unwind from the travel, maybe shower again depending on the day. My rest is delayed by at least an hour. All just to meaningless be in an office just because. It's no wonder we are now coming in under target again. People are tired. 

        Aside from that the lack of travelling also served as a nice little salary bump for many employees. It just seems so senseless to throw away all the advantages. So many companies seem to be willing to do that. I would have thought Apple would be world leaders in pushing apst these traditional barriers. In any case, much of my job is the same, I love the stability of this company, but I find myself looking for new opportunities because I was flourishing while WFH. Both at my job and at my life. Perfect work/life balance was at my finger tips the whole time and I just didn't know the office itself was the obstacle.

        I was hired during the pandemic and have been WFH for most of my time with Apple. I onboarded remotely. I led initiatives remotely. I built amazing new tools and demoed them to my org remotely. None of this was new to me as I've worked fully-remote for most of the last decade.

        The RTO pilot, in how it has been communicated and implemented, has very much soured my experience at Apple. My team is distributed geographically so I'm still working on Slack and WebEx, but in a loud, hot and stuffy office. Each day I visit the office I get a COVID exposure notice. Needless to say my productivity has declined since the RTO pilot began.

        The environment inside Apple takes the joy away from me, that I would otherwise be putting into my work & sharing with my colleagues. The joy that I've been able to cultivate in my first year WFH with Apple. Give us flexibility in how we RTO and we can keep that joy alive.

        The notion of geographic diversity is spot on. As the world grows with itself, it's becoming increasingly naive to think that talented minds can be bound to specific attributes about a person; especially where they are willing to live and what they are willing to give up.

        Historically, Apple as a company has been heavily associated with innovation, mostly due to a relentless vision. Times are changing, however. People are realizing that there is more to life beyond work. They are less inclined to relocate and spend precious hours away from family and friends. In this enlightened era, a shared vision is much more likely to be realized if personal factors don't inhibit people from contributing altogether.

        I hope you are well and sound!

        I am writing this email to express to you my desire to work from home for the long term foreseeable future. I have thought about this thoroughly and there are some reasons that make me believe it is for the best.

        When we initially transitioned remotely, I was very skeptical about it and didn’t know how it will affect my life. Now, I’m sure it made my life much better. The time I spent commuting and getting ready for work is substituted with other beneficial personal activities. I have more time to work and improve myself to become a better person and I’m sure it reflects and will continue to reflect on my job’s performance. 

        Also, the current inflation that is occurring throughout the entire nation and the increase in gas prices became a serious concern for me financially. My financial situation currently cannot afford the commute to work and the related expenses because I have been trying to save up money to buy a house. Every dollar saved is a great help for my future. So, by working from home, I will continue to have better control over my budget and overall finances to buy a house and support my family.  

        In addition, on April 2, 2022, Ramadan is starting, and it is a holy month for Muslims around the world. As a Muslim who fasts every year, I would love to observe the religious month and fast working remotely. Over the last two years, I have found comfort in being able to pray at the convenience of my home and would love to continue my practice of praying while working remotely. 

        Therefore, I kindly ask that you consider my reasons to work from home for the foreseeable future so that I can continue my efficiency in performance and have great control over my life. Ever since we transitioned, my work performance has never decreased. I want to assure you it will always stay the same and better.

        Please let me know if you have any questions and I look forward to talking to you.

        The vast majority of Apple employees have demonstrated time and again that where ideas and vision come to life are where they are in the moment - not just contained behind magnetically sealed doors or at official (albeit beautiful) buildings during a formal shift.

        We were all inspired to "Think Different". Why would the leadership of Apple want to undo that guiding principle so quickly by insisting on thinking about doing things the same way we used to just because that's "normal"?

        As a SWE employee, I would love the opportunity to work from home as I have proven myself to deliver high quality work from home over the last two years, including earning a promotion. 

        The Apple Park office I work in is full of distractions and interruptions that I do not get while working from home. Most of us have grown up in the internet age and know how to easily communicate with one another when we need to reach someone. But in office work leads to easy, non-work related distractions that cannot be avoided without fear of being dismissive. 

        The "water cooler" moments do NOT exist. We are all gated by disclosures and cannot organically have these conversations in VERY PUBLIC SPACES at Apple Park, especially when sound carried very easily through those halls. 

        I would even gladly take a pay cut and give up access to prototype devices to be allowed to work from home, possibly in a more affordable area. 

        I have been with Apple for almost two decades. I love this company and what it stands for - its values speak to the heart of the work we do every day. I truly wish Apple would value its heart and soul, its people, and let them and their managers decide what is best for their work rather than some worry that the $5b spaceship will be empty. Trust me - that's not going to happen. AP is overcrowded as it is with teams being reorg'd and moved out even in the last week. 

        Even if we gave employees who CAN do their work from home, and have proven they can, the choice, there will 100% still be employees who HAVE to come to the office as their job physically cannot be done without it. And with all of the extra space in AP, we'd be able to stop leasing some buildings throughout the area and move more teams into the office.

        I hope Apple, and Tim, take a look at the current situation and reconsider their stance.

        As it would for the thousands of other employees who find themselves in similar situations. 

        I in fact am happy to work in the office. Yet there are days, weeks, when I know it would be better for myself, my colleagues and my work that I stay at home. Mental health, especially among younger generations, is a precarious thing. Remote work allows us to flexibly deal with inconsistent issues. To not have to worry about the bad days and when they may strike

        It would also draw more people to Apple, as increasingly younger, less established but rapidly growing companies do offer remote work. 

        Apple will be left behind eventually. 

        Apple has always prided itself on thinking different, on leading the next wave of innovation.

        comment="I personally enjoy socializing with friends on campus, but working onsite often means much of the day is consumed with this. With the commute, and the distractions of hallway or pod conversations means I get little actual work done. While at home, I can shut the door to my office and really focus. But, I'm still available for meetings and quick slack questions. Scheduling meetings is so easy, and there is no conflict on a meeting room.  Also, I get to spend more time with my favorite people, my wife and kids, helping them with a school question, working through math problems, even teaching them how to code.  The hybrid work plan is all pain and no gain for me."

        comment="Remote work would allow me to spend more time doing what I love and what I want - more time with my family, more time cultivating my happiness, and more time innovating on the products which will power our company forward. My happiness is my greatest motivator - without it, I cannot do my life's best work."

        comment="When I have flexibility I can spend more time with my family and be available to work with colleagues worldwide. When I'm forced to be at the office I spend less time with my family only to collaborate with people in other Apple offices and sometimes in an entirely different continent."

        comment="In terms of “being young enough to start a new life in a new city/country”- that is me. I am a young lady who sacrificed for Apple to relocate to another city. I did not receive any support nor relocation package to-do so either. I'm a first generation college graduate and minority of color who dreamed to work for Apple. Yet, my family is poor and remains poor despite my salary that's all utilized to pay for essential expenses to “start a new life in a new city”. I'm speaking on behalf of many other young minorities who come from similar backgrounds and also dream to work for Apple. We are not of less talent. We are simply not privileged nor will we ever reach the same level with the current system in play."
