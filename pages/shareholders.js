          <h3>Hello, Apple Shareholders!</h3>
          <span>(if you owned AAPL stock as of January 3rd 2022, that&apos;s you! Though it does not include any unvested RSUs you may have from the company, anything that is vested counts!)</span>
          <p>
            We&apos;d like to draw attention to the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders and the fact that you have a say in the matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before the meeting, shareholders can vote for or against a number of proposals coming from either the current Apple Board of Directors or shareholders themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            To aid you in that process, we&apos;ve put together some information and some recommendations on voting, but urge each and everyone of you to do your own due diligence, to start the conversation with one another, to debate the merits, and follow your values when voting.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no perfect choice in an imperfect world, but you can start sending a message today about your values. 
          </p>

                Apple&apos;s board recommends voting <strong>FOR</strong> the nomination of all. Workers disagree.

                    <li>
                        <h6>James Bell</h6>
                        <p>He was CFO and corporate president of Boeing between 2008 and 2011. Around the same time frame, according to Public Campaign, Boeing laid off more than 14k workers and increased executive pay by 31%. All of this was a decade ago and he wasn&apos;t the sole C-level of the company, but may still be something to keep an eye on.</p>

                        <p>Additionally, he is a board member of JPMorgan, which is the largest bank in the US as of Sep 2021 and also seems to be one of largest lenders to the fossil fuel industry in the world. Again, this doesn&apos;t necessarily impact Apple&apos;s environmental policies, but might be something to keep an eye on.</p>

                        <h6>Tim Cook</h6>
                        <p>Cook has built tremendous wealth for the company (and thus for some of you), but in light of recent concerns of Retail, AppleCare, and Corporate employees regarding working conditions, Cook has shown there are voices he is willing to ignore.  Is it time to send him a message?</p>

                        <p>We recommend voting <strong>AGAINST</strong> his nomination. Gorsky knowingly defrauded children and the elderly through an illegal kickback scheme with nursing homes.</p>

                        <p>We recommend voting <strong>FOR</strong> her nomination.  While Jung&apos;s involvement with multi-level marketing (Avon) might be off-putting to some, we appreciate her commitment to advocating for ending domestic and gender based violence. We hope this commitment to gender equality will allow for less retaliation, and dare we hope active address, at Apple when it comes to pay disparity.</p>

                        <p>We recommend voting <strong>FOR</strong> her nomination. Lozano has had a concerted interest in racial equity, immigration, and has some experience going against the grain to do what&apos;s right (like combating prejudice at the height of the AIDS epidemic).</p>

                <p>We don't have a recommendation on the approval.</p> 

                <p>We understand this one&apos;s a little &quot;pie in the sky&quot;, but the idea of codifying social values in the incorporation statement is promising. </p>
                
                <p>It also explicitly calls out that Apple needs to listen to workers&apos; voices, which we appreciate, but find that the necessary changes to make Apple ready to restructure as a SPC are among the other proposals listed, and need to be carried out before-hand.</p>

                <p>We recommend voting <strong>FOR</strong> this proposal, which is about Chinese censorship and human rights, and calls for transparency in why Apple chooses to remove certain apps after the Chinese government asks them to. It is not only feasible, but if Apple believes in human rights, it is also obvious.</p>

                <h5>Proposal 7: Forced Labor Report</h5>
                <p>Apple&apos;s board recommends voting AGAINST this shareholder proposal entitled &quot;Report on Forced Labor.&quot;</p>

                <p>We recommend voting <strong>FOR</strong> this proposal, as it is similar to the proposal above and adds considerations of Uyghur labour, among others. Again an obvious yes. We question Apple&apos;s commitment to human rights by recommending against this important proposal.</p>

                <p>We recommend voting <strong>FOR</strong>, as it asks for transparency on pay equity, which Apple has repeatedly claimed it is committed to maintaining. This is a clear path to ensuring that is true, and accountability for any gaps.</p>

                <p>We recommend voting <strong>FOR</strong>. This is a direct response to the Antonio Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez letter, data gathered in the pay equity surveys, and a lack of progress in diversifying its workforce, asking that Apple actually address what those movements were about.</p>

                <p>Apple&apos;s board recommends voting AGAINST this shareholder proposal entitled &quot;Report on Concealment Clauses.&quot;</p>

                <p>We recommend voting <strong>FOR</strong>, as it is a direct response to AppleToo and is the source of former Apple Employee&apos;s SEC filing.</p>

                <p>Apple uses concealment clauses in settlement agreements to prevent employees from speaking about their and their colleagues&apos; experiences. The proposal asks for a re-examination of that practice, since it puts the company at risk for getting sued and found criminally liable.</p>
